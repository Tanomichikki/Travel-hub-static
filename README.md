#### **☁️ AWS Deployment Breakdown**

**🪣 Amazon S3 — Static Hosting**

The website's dist/ folder is uploaded into an S3 bucket configured for static hosting.

🔹 Why Static Website Hosting?

- S3 can host HTML, CSS, JS directly

- No backend server required

- Highly scalable and cost-efficient

**🔹 Why Uncheck Block All Public Access?**

S3 blocks public access by default for security.
But a public-facing website must be accessible to everyone.
We uncheck it only for this bucket because it contains public frontend assets, not sensitive data.

**🔹 Why Add a Bucket Policy?**

Even after allowing public access, AWS still protects the bucket.
A bucket policy explicitly gives read-only access to all users:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures:

- Only GET requests are allowed

- No write or delete operations

- Safe for static content



### ***🌐 Amazon CloudFront — Global CDN + HTTPS***

S3 website endpoints only support **HTTP**, which is insecure.
To deploy the website professionally, CloudFront is used.

🔹 Why CloudFront?

- Enables full HTTPS (S3 cannot provide HTTPS on custom/static endpoints)

- Global edge locations make the site load faster

- Adds caching, improving performance and reducing S3 costs

- Ensures SEO ranking and browser trust

- Hides the S3 bucket URL for better security

Key CloudFront Settings:

- Origin: S3 Website Endpoint

- Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP → HTTPS

- Default Root Object: index.html
